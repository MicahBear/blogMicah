          So.... I probably like many have had the bug(haha) for developing for
          some time now. I had the opportunity to learn from a friend who is a
          great Software Engineer. Learning from him for the few months we had
          was great but of course his work took off and rightfully so. I felt
          behind, not capable, ... blah blah. The usual self-doubt and thus
          reasoning with yourself that you should probably do something else
          with your time, give up, or move on.

          I went back to farming, quick info: I have been a farmer for about 5+
          years and now I just farm on my own 1/4 with my partner, that quickly
          didn't work out as I was looking for something else and maybe it was
          the cumulation of working with people I had worked with already and
          that I honestly hadn't given my full commitment to this process and
          realizing it is about growth and one step at a time.
