      <h1>Actually Excited... Even though I am tired.</h1>
      <p>
        I didn't expect to find myself excited about developing my portfolio...
        But I am. And that is the biggest surprise to me. Here is the deal I
        thought with working 100devs I would do as Leon suggested. Grab a
        template and make it go. The most important thing is getting it done and
        making it your own. I like having this blog as a place to write and
        collect my thoughts, and I plan to do more of that here so others who
        are in the roller coaster as me can let me know what they think, help me
        out, or learn something from me. I have been nervous just to get to this
        point I believe that I am mostly worried of not being enough. These last
        couple years have been a couple challanging ones and it is also the
        reason why I didn't think I would be here again trying to push the cart
        up the hill. I don't think I would change anything either. I hope I feel
        this way in a few months. Well until next time, be kind to yourselves.
